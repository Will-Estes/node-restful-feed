You'll need to create an .env file at the base directory that contains the following: <br />
    PORT - What port you want to run the app on <br />
    MONGODB_URI - The mongo database url (made mine for free on mongo atlas) <br />
    JWT_SECRET - The secret to be used for json web tokens for your app <br />
    
To run the app, run `npm start` from the base directory
